#Comment: Dose rate can be given with a unit:
#"Gy/s" for Gray per second,
#"e/A2s" for electrons per square angstroem second,
#"e/nm2s" for electrons per square nm per second
dose rate = 1.55e7 Gy/s
#Comment: liquid thickness must be given in meters
liquid thickness = 5e-7
#Comment: end of the simulation in seconds
duration = 1e6
#Comment: flow velocity in m/s
flow velocity = 0.0
#Comment: beamlength; how much length in flow direction is being illuminated in m; also used for diffusion
length = 6.5e-9
#Comment: Default diffusion coefficient in m^2/s; usually 2.1e-9; calculated from Kang-Paper: 1.29e-18
diffusioncoefficient = 2.1e-9
#Comment: Temperature in K to calculate rate constants
temperature = 293
#Comment: Potential in V
potential = 0.0
#Comment: Percentage to what extend G2 or G1 values specified in conditions are used: 0.0 => 100% G1 + 0% G2, 1.0 => 0% G1 + 100% G2
#Comment: To calculate a temperature, say T_target, T_Gvalueset1, T_Gvalueset2; via: ratio = (T_target - T_Gvalueset1) / (T_Gvalueset2 - T_Gvalueset1)  
G2 to G1 ratio = 0.0
