#Comment: Dose rate can be given with a unit:
#"Gy/s" for Gray per second,
#"e/A2s" for electrons per square angstroem second,
#"e/nm2s" for electrons per square nm per second
dose rate = 1e3 e/nm2s
#Comment: liquid thickness must be given in meters
liquid thickness = 1e-7
#Comment: end of the simulation in seconds
duration = 1e3
