# AuRaCh - Automated Radiation Chemistry Simulations

AuRaCh is a tool for automating the creation of coupled differential equation sets in radiation chemistry.

Its working principle is described in:

To run the code, please acknowledge the required dependencies.
If you are new to running python scripts, I propose to use Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution.
Its default environment should be able to run all files uploaded here.

I used Notepad++ to set up the reaction text file, so the spacing is adjusted to display properly using this software. https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ 

Naturally, this code is still under ongoing development. I invite you to contribute :)
